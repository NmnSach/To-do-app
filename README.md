# To-do-app

The ToDo List application is constructed using a powerful combination of Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose, delivering an intuitive solution for managing tasks. Express.js handles server-side routing and manages incoming requests, while Mongoose facilitates smooth interaction with a MongoDB database.

The application enables users to securely register and log in, with the database verifying their login credentials. Once authenticated, users can effectively handle tasks by adding, viewing, and removing them. Mongoose schemas are employed to organize user information and task data within the database, guaranteeing the integrity of the stored data.
